Oregon Department of Agriculture inspections of food establishments

This Jupyter notebook and associated data reference files will process inspection data from the Oregon Department of Agriculture.
The files are in Excel and constitute tables exported from a relational database. ODA supplies many more files than we use. 

The notebook file uses Pandas data frames to convert the records into three usable tables for ourline searchable database. The
output files are inspections.csv, violations.csv, and facilities.csv.

The keeper of the raw data is Sarah Schwab of ODA, sschwab@oda.state.or.us, 503-508-6028.

Monthly datasets are currently stored internally in the OR Data sharepoint folder, under "in progress" and "food-safety."
